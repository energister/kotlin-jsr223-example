# Kotlin script engine usage example

The project is a simple demonstration of the [Kotlin script engine](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/whatsnew11.html#javaxscript-support) functionality. It's a Maven adaptation of the JetBrain's [kotlin-jsr223-local-example](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/tree/master/libraries/examples/kotlin-jsr223-local-example). 

The engine is able to execute scripts written on Kotlin right from your application (written on any Java-compatible language). This project demonstrates in-process execution (no other processes are spawn).
